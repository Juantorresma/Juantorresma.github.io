            <h3>Explain to a child what is the problem you are trying to solve. Use images or other multimedia resources.
 </h3>
            <p>Have you ever been grounded by your father for not waking up on time for school? Have you ever missed the bus school? If you have had this problems is because you didn’t set your alarm the way it was supposed to be, let me explain myself. When we are studying or working for long hours and we go to bed pass midnight our body doesn’t work the same way and the only thing you think about is reach your bed and rest, right? Next morning you have a very important exam at your elementary school but your parents can’t take you there because they will be busy so they ask you Set an Alarm and be on time. You grab your smartphone go to bed and set an alarm for 6:30 but surprise mate it was 6:30 PM not AM which means you will be on a deep sleep and you aren’t going to be  worry about the school. You wake up 7:00 AM and the school bus leaves at 7:10 AM are you going to be on time? Probably not. W

We’re working very hard to search for a solution for this problem and share it among all students and workers all around the world.

            <h3>Describe your personal motivations to solve the problem. Write some formal solutions, that have already been created, to that problem. Write your references.
 </h3>
            <p>Our personal motivations is that we are students who have suffered this problem for many years, since we were on high school and studying became more demanding. As a student we know the struggle of waking up early and even though we set an alarm we are scared that it might not wake us up. 

There is something called Jailbreak that is only for iOS devices there is an App Store called Cydia in which you can install, themes, tweaks, widgets etc. A tweak called “PM, Really?” tries to solve this problem by giving the user an alert that the alarm he is setting is for PM not AM.

 </h3>
            <p>First we had to focus on a certain group of people, in this case mainly students and workers.<p>We had to understand the problem and work it out from the inside and then go to the outside. </p>
<p>Once we identified the problem and its origins we were able to determine what the solution will be. </p>
<p>We had to do some research whether solutions for this problem have been created. </p>
<p>If there are solutions already created we will innovate those.</p>

            <p>First I had a teammate and I explained him this idea yet the next class I found out that he betrayed me but Thank God he didn’t stole my idea. I can’t say I have been the best partner to this project because I joined late but I can say that I’ve been giving ideas and valuable information to make this project easier and funnier for the whole team.

            <p>I have learned a lot, i didnt even knew hot to make an HTML page before i came here, i have been working a lot to learn new things and how to use the tools that the teacher provides for us. Proyectwise i have been researching a lot with the methodology that we saw in the reading about the Olympic games.</p>

            <h3>Imagine a solution for your problem. Write a page (it could be the same page) using html/css to answer.
 </h3>
            <p>Our solution is to make an app that you can set the priority of the alarm by making it level 1 through 5 and depending on the level of priority it will sound harder. We would also like to add that the app has an alert system in which it will the user if he really wants to set an alarm for PM instead of AM.

            <h3>Explain who is the audience of your problem (project problem).
 </h3>
            <p>The audience whose problem is dedicated is everyone, we are trying to promote this problem from kids to old people, why? Everyone needs an alarm whether is just to wake up early, go to an important appointment, get up to work/school or just for the morning run. Throughout the years many people have had the excuse of saying “Sorry for being late, my alarm didn’t went off.” This is one of the multiple examples that someone can have as an excuse for being late.

            <h3>Propose a no technological solution for your problem. Use CSS3 animations.

 

 </h3>
            <p>A non technological solution for our problem is to teach the audience why being on time is very important, if you can’t wake up when your alarm goes off then why would someone have interest on you? Waking up for any appointment or reason is very important because that demonstrates commitment by the person and interest for his/her appointment.

            <p>We have decided that our grade is 98, as Oscar mentioned on the evaluation he joined late and that’s why we couldn’t make the project the way we wanted it to be due to time and limit resources for the information yet we are committed to make this project one of the best if not the best of the classroom.
